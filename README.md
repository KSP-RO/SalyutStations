**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my [Soviet Spacecraft](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SovietSpacecraft) to use with this. It is the sister mod meant to be used with this.**

**I HIGHLY reccommend downloading my [Soviet Rockets](https://github.com/KSP-RO/SovietRockets) to use with this. It is required to launch all of these probes and you need it to use the craft files.**

This is a salyut mod for the DOS & OPS style stations. It contains fully functional replicas of Salyut 1, 4, 6 and 7. It also now contains Almaz 2, 3 and 5. These can be used interchangeably with the other DOS/OPS stations of the same series although they may have had a different color scheme.

##STOCK Remotetech Support:
* If you use remotetech, here is a module manager config to make the stations compatible: [https://www.dropbox.com/s/6h8vu19gzxkr413/Salyut_Soyuz_RT.cfg?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/s/6h8vu19gzxkr413/Salyut_Soyuz_RT.cfg?dl=0)

##Install instructions:
* Download and install mod from here

##ALMAZ NOTES:
* Please use the included craft file as the film capsule is difficult to place and the station requires the Salyut ASAS to function. I hid this inside the station mesh in the craft file.
* The film capsule has NO SAS OR REACTION WHEELS, as it did in real life. You need to point the entire station so the capsule in facing retrograde before ejecting it. Once ejected fire the retro rockets. When it enters the atmosphere, drag will cause it to turn to face the right way for reentry. You then manually deploy the parachutes. Make sure it lands ON LAND.
* The station telescope has hullcam support


##NOTES:

* This mod is no longer compatible with Bobcat of OLDD protons as I have made my own
* KOSMOS is required for the craft files to load as they contain solar arrays
* You MUST use the Salyut ASAS to properly control the stations!
